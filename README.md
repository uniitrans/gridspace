# gridspace

The entirety of this respository is an extract from my project. I believe this grid system, albeit basic, is succinct and easily adaptable enough to suit most without the hassle of trying to adapt an existing grid system framework.

#### 'gridspace' In A Nutshell

1. Relies on the device's native view width.
2. Designed on the basis of percentages.
3. Not hard coded in terms of the width structure.

#### Known Issues
1. Not compatible with older browsers, namely pre-IE9 as well as Opera Mini.
2. The use of calc() function in CSS does not work in older versions of Android.
